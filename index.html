        <h2>A blog, again</h2>

<h3>What was wrong with the old blog?</h3>

<ol>
<li>I had trouble getting the formatting just right.</li>
<li>Google does a nice job of tracking your users and pageviews, but I don't want to know those things.</li>
<li>I'd like to move this to my own webserver, eventually.</li>
</ol><h3>Why blog?</h3>

<p>If you're not suspicious about your impulses to tell the world what you're thinking, maybe you should be. Sometimes I consider heading down to Kinko's, printing out twenty copies of some handwritten newsletter, and sending it off to those I think might care. On the other hand, there's that possibility of a kindred spirit stumbling across your writing.</p>
