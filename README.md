==========================

This is where William's trying to re-locate his blog.

It used to be called "[William Writes][oldblog]." It was on Blogspot.

[oldblog]: http://williamwrites.blogspot.com/ "William Writes"

TODO:
* Move sidebar html to _includes so that templates can share it
* Add home page link to sidebar list
* Make archive page
** Post category: blog?
* Make external archive page
** If I make a category for external links, I can add them with a little bit of commentary.
** But they shouldn't show up on the main page.
** Post category: articles?
* Add post navigation mechanism for blog posts
** This should only work within categories
