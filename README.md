==========================

This is where William's trying to re-locate his blog.

TODO:
* Change permalinks to use date style
  * Does this automatically give you archive pages?
  * If not, can you show posts by year/month/etc?
* Make external archive page
  * If I make a category for external links, I can add them with a little bit of commentary.
  * But they shouldn't show up on the main page.
  * Post category: articles?
* Add post navigation mechanism for blog posts
  * This should only work within categories
