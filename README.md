==========================

This is where William's trying to re-locate his blog.

It used to be called "[William Writes][oldblog]." It was on Blogspot.

[oldblog]: http://williamwrites.blogspot.com/ "William Writes"

TODO:
* Make external archive page
  * If I make a category for external links, I can add them with a little bit of commentary.
  * But they shouldn't show up on the main page.
  * Post category: articles?
* Format sidebar links
  * Maybe have normal and visible be the same, but have 'em light up on mousover
  * a la [Janna's site](http://jannadyk.tumblr.com/)
* Add post navigation mechanism for blog posts
  * This should only work within categories
