I should also mention here that I wrote two posts about logic for First
Thoughts:

* "[In Defense of Symbolic Logic](http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/12/10/kreefts-confusing-logic/)"
* "[More on Symbolic vs. Aristotelian Logic](http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/12/19/more-on-symbolic-v-aristotelian-logic/)"

Writing about logic made me wish I could set everything aside and actually do
some research on current schools of thought in mathematical and philosophical
logic, but there's only so much time.
